        <p class="sub-right">Pilates focuses on working and strengthening your core – abdominal, back, pelvic floor and glutes muscles – you’ll find that one of the benefits of Pilates is that you will develop more controlled movements and slimmer stomach. The exercises involve the use of primary muscles as well as deeper muscles in the body. During the first few sessions, you will feel muscles you didn’t know existed. Pilates help tone the whole body as muscle recruitment takes into account the stability-mobility relationship. Contract the muscles to generate movement and the rest of the body to be engaged maintaining stability to allow efficient and effective moves. This is especially good for older people and those who are normally quite sedated in their daily life as muscle tone is usually lost with age and inactivity.</p>

            <h3 id="sub-sec">flexibility</h3>
            <p class="sub-left">Lifestyle and the natural ageing process play a role in the loss of flexibility. Pilates movements are done sequentially to restore your flexibility. Even after the first session, you will feel the difference. As your body becomes more flexible you will be less prone to injuries and falls.Pilates is a great way to fast-track your body to better alignment. With a focus on balanced muscle development, proper alignment is an integral part of each exercise in the Pilates method. In your workout, you’ll work to re-establish more efficient postural patterns until an improved postural habit is developed – and then you’ll work even harder to maintain these patterns as you progress into more challenging exercises.</p>
