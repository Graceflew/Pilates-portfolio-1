TESTING
- I have tested the website in different browsers chrome & safari
- I can confirm that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on various screen sizes
- I confirm that the navigation, home, learn & sign up pages are all readable and easy to understand
- I have confirmed that the form works, and will accept only an email address in the form.

BUGS
- I noticed when I deployed the page, the titles weren't the same on each page 
- I fixed this by changing over the titles to make sure they match on each page of the site
